# sudoku-solver project 
## About The Project

This is an automatic sudoku solver using OpenCV and Deep learning, the project is deployed using FastApi and dockerized with docker.
we use a digits classifier to get the puzzle then solve it in 5 steps :

* Read the image containing the Sudoku puzzle provided by the user â€‹(must be a 9X9 sudoku image)
* Locate the puzzle board and extract it
* Locate each of the cells of the Sudoku board and read the digit if exist
* Apply the sudoku solver algorithm
* Write the answer digits and display the output image
